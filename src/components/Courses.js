              We wanted to showcase the different industries in the tech field
              for people who are seeking an informed decision on which
              subsection to choose. We threw away technical jargon in order to
              show empathy to those outside the industry, and to quiz them based
              on their personality, their technical capabilities. All people are
              capable of pursuing a career in the tech field, and it is our job
              to help find their niche based on their personality.

              We surveyed 70 current tech students, interviewed 13 tech
              students, and 2 tech instructors. We discovered that all tracks in
              the tech field are extremely similar, but subtle differences
              between each emerged from analyzing the data. We created questions
              that do not deal with tech, but relate to how people in different
              tech fields think. Keep in mind, anyone has the capability to
              succeed in any career, and this quiz should not hinder someones
              passion for a particular tech field.

                A university is the more traditional form of schooling. Often
                seen as more credible, but will cost a pretty penny. Many
                universities have online courses, but more often than not, they
                requiere you to attend on campus which will be restricitng based
                on your geographical location.

                A bootcamp is a new way of taking classes. Since they are newer,
                they are less credible than universities that have been around
                for a while. They are often online, and online schools have the
                advantage of updating and including the most up to date content
                more easily than a traditional university. But be careful, since
                it is easier to start an online course, many people opt in to do
                this in order to monetize people who may want to take shortcuts
                in getting an education.
