            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-900">
              A university is the more traditional form of schooling. Often seen
              as more credible, but will cost a pretty penny. Many universities
              have online courses, but more often than not, they requiere you to
              attend on campus which will be restricitng based on your
              geographical location.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-900">
              A bootcamp is a new way of taking classes. Since they are newer,
              they are less credible than universities that have been around for
              a while. They are often online, and online schools have the
              advantage of updating and including the most up to date content
              more easily than a traditional university. But be careful, since
              it is easier to start an online course, many people opt in to do
              this in order to monetize people who may want to take shortcuts in
              getting an education.
