Sorting Hat is a quiz application that suggests students the top ranking tracks that they can further look into based on their interests and what they find most important in a job.

### Key Features

-    Quiz asks questions that are engaging
-    Results of the quiz are displayed in a bar graph
-    Description of each track is available
-    Extra resources are provided to help start the research
-    Schools are provided in the Courses section

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### _React_

Why did you choose this framework?

-    Unidirectional Data Flow is easy and viable for this product
-    Components make react highly reusable
-    Easy to be used for mobile and desktop
-    Huge Community of support

#### _Redux_

Why did you choose this library?

-    easy to test
-    single store to reuse objects

#### _Cypress Testing_

Why did you choose this library?

-    End to end testing
-    GUI is intuitive
-    low learning curve

#### _Jest Testing_

Why did you choose this library?

-    specialized for unit testing
-    works well with code climate

#### Front end deployed to [Amplify AWS](https://www.sortinghat.tech/)

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/sorting-hat-be) built using:

#### NodeJS

-    built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime which is convenient as Javascript is the only choice to develop new web applications in the web browser.
-    adding/changing functionality is easy as changes to the source code aren't needed.
-    lightweight as its executions are a series of asynchronous callback.

# APIs

## Backend API
 
This backend API allows for the front end application to interact with the back end database to display questions and results of the quiz as desired.

# Environment Variables

This app does not require any environment variables for it to work. Optionally you can add a .env file containing the following:

    *  SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true - sometimes rca brings a preflight check error in which case set this variable to true

# Content Licenses

ðŸš«For all content - images, icons, etc, use this table to document permission of use. Remove the two placeholders and add you content to this table

# Testing

We used Cypress for the end to end testing to mimick user interactions. We used Jest react testing for the integration testing as jest is better suited for testing the business logic of an application.

# Installation Instructions

Run `yarn install` to install the required dependencies to get this project up and running with yarn.

## Other Scripts

    * build - creates a build of the application
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs all test builds
    * cypress:coverage - runs cypress tests in the integration folder and saves the coverage in coverage/cypress-coverage directory.
    * test:jest - runs jest tests and saves the coverage in coverage/jest-coverage directory.
